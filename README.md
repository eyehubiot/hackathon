EyeHub IoT Hackathon Support Material
=====================================

This repository contains some sample scripts and general information for developers who want to write code to talk to the EyeHub IoT service.

For a general introduction to talking to the EyeHub API, the [BootstrappingADevice.md](BootstrappingADevice.md) file is your best starting point.  That will introduce the other PDFs and documents available.

Once you get to wrangling code, there are some sample scripts in each of the subdirectories.  Choose the one for the language you'll be using (or the language which is nearest to the one you'll be using... ;-)
